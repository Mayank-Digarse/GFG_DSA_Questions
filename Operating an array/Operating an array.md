Given an array A of size N, your task is to do some operations, i.e., search an element x, insert an element y at index yi, and delete an element z by completing the functions. Also, all functions should return a boolean value.

Note: In delete operation return true even if element is not present.

Input Format:

Input:
5
2 4 1 0 6
1 2 2 0

Output:
1 1 1
Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you only need to complete the provided functions.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
0 <= Ai <= 1000
